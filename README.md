# UCSD-Python4DS-Mini-Project
This is the mini project for UCSD python for data science. The goal of the project is to use the World Development Indicator on Kaggle to find a specific phenomenon and use python libraries(Pandas & NumPy) to show the result.

The project can be used by Jupyter Notebook.

My work is focused on analyzing the correlation between hospital beds and average age. I use the data from Arab world and found that through out the years, people's average age increase. At the same time, they need fewer beds.
